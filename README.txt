This is README file for the application "Password breaker" made in Excel VBA.
As the name suggests, its purpose is cracking the password to another selected Excel file.

About using the application:
(You need to accept using macros in excel for the application to run)
First, choose the file to be cracked.
Next I recommend opening the settings menu and choosing which characters to try when attempting to crack the password. Depending on its lenght it may take quite a long time. Afterwards click the start button. The application will check the basic settings, and  the cracking process will start.
After it will be finished, application will keep the cracked Excel file open as well as display the password in a message prompt. 

Warnings:
1. Please save the file on a SSD drive on other solid-state storage device. The application attempts to open the same file each time a password is tested, so it can wear down a hard drive or optical drive very quickly.
(I would recommend using a RAM disc in case of heavy protected files)
2. When attempting to crack the password on less powerfull machines the program may unexpectedly stop if you perform too many actions in another programs (sometimes happen on one of my laptops) - in this case you can just close it either normaly by stopping macro & closing file or with task manager.
3.If you would like to make some changes to the code, you can view the original file by clicking the "Developer Mode" button in settings.
